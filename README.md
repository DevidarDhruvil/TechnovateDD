# Dynamic Dashboard

## Overview
Dynamic Dashboard is an interactive web application built with Angular, designed to create, manage, and visualize data queries, tables, charts, and dashboards. It allows users to build SQL queries dynamically, execute operations on data (e.g., filtering, joining, grouping), and display results in a user-friendly three-panel interface (left panel for queries, center panel for tables, and right panel for operations). The application integrates with an API service for data retrieval and supports real-time SQL generation and manipulation.

This project is ideal for data analysts, developers, or anyone needing a customizable tool to explore and manage database queries interactively.

## Features
- **Query Management**: Create, edit, and delete queries with a simple interface.
- **Table Operations**: Select tables, choose columns, filter rows, join tables, append data, and add custom operations.
- **SQL Generation**: View and copy dynamically generated SQL queries based on user operations.
- **Interactive Layout**: Three-panel design (left for queries, center for data tables, right for operations) with overlays for advanced functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well across different screen sizes with scrollable sections for large datasets.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Fetch and display data from an API in real time, with support for charts and dashboards (to be expanded).

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Angular (TypeScript, HTML, CSS)
- **Styling**: CSS with custom styles for layout and responsiveness
- **Icons**: Font Awesome for visual elements
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Roboto, Open Sans, IBM Plex Sans)
- **API**: Custom API service for data retrieval (e.g., table names, column names, table data)
- **Dependencies**: Angular modules (CommonModule, FormsModule), external libraries for fonts and icons

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Angular CLI** (install via `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/DevidarDhruvil/TechnovateDD.git)
   cd dynamic-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up API Service**
   - Ensure you have an API endpoint for data retrieval (e.g., table names, columns, data). Update the `ApiService` in `src/app/Services/api.service.ts` with your API URL.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     private apiUrl = 'http://your-api-endpoint.com';
     ```

4. **Run the Application**
   Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

## Usage
1. Launch the application in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:4200`).
2. Use the left panel to add and manage queries (e.g., "Query 1", "Query 2").
3. Select a query to view or edit its table data in the center panel.
4. Use the right panel to perform operations (e.g., select tables, filter rows, join tables) and generate SQL queries.
5. Click "View SQL" in the right panel to open the SQL Template Overlay, displaying the generated SQL, which you can copy or close.

## Project Structure
- `src/app/app.component.ts`: Main TypeScript component logic for the dashboard.
- `src/app/app.component.html`: HTML template for the three-panel layout and overlays.
- `src/app/app.component.css`: CSS styles for layout and design.
- `src/app/Services/api.service.ts`: Service for API calls to fetch data.
- `src/app/components/header/header.component.*`: Header component (if applicable).
